## Introduction: From Operational Overload to Strategic Clarity  

The proposed solution is a unified, intelligent platform centered around an AI agent. This system is designed not as a passive tool, but as a proactive business analyst. By allowing owners to manage their operations through natural language, the system aims to eliminate the complexity and tedious data entry that characterize existing software.  

The following user stories are built on this core principle, reimagining standard ERP tasks as simple, conversational interactions that empower the owner to move from "fire-fighting" to strategic, data-driven decision-making.

## AI-Agent ERP for Small Restaurants – User Stories  

### Epic 1: Purchasing & Inventory  

| Priority     | User Story                                                                                   | Task Example                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Must-have    | As a manager, I want to tell the AI about new stock purchases by forwarding an invoice or sending a simple message, so the system updates inventory automatically. | User uploads a supplier invoice PDF; AI parses it and confirms stock update. |
| Must-have    | As a chef/manager, I want to ask the AI about current stock levels in real-time, so I can plan daily operations without checking a complex dashboard. | User asks, "Hey, how many kilos of tomatoes do we have left?" |
| Must-have    | As a manager, I want the AI to proactively alert me when stock is low and suggest a reorder list, so I can act before we run out. | AI sends a notification: "Heads up! You're low on tomatoes and onions. Ready to order?" |
| Nice-to-have | As a manager, I want the AI to draft purchase orders for my approval based on sales trends and stock levels, so I can save time on procurement. | AI suggests: "Based on last week's sales, I’ve drafted a purchase order for your main supplier. Please review." |
| Nice-to-have | As a staff member, I want to scan a product's barcode or QR code and have the AI instantly recognize and update the inventory, so data entry is faster and more accurate. | User scans a box of chicken; AI confirms, "Got it. 20kg of chicken added to stock." |

|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Must-have    | As a chef, I want to describe a recipe to the AI in natural language, so the system can automatically link ingredients and track usage when a dish is sold. | Chef says: "The 'Frango à Parmegiana' uses 200g chicken, 100g cheese, and 150ml tomato sauce." |
| Must-have    | As a manager, I want to ask the AI for the cost and profit margin of any dish, so I can make informed pricing decisions. | Manager asks: "What's the profit margin on our 'Frango à Parmegiana'?" |
| Must-have    | As a chef, I want to ask the AI how many portions of a dish I can make with the current stock, so I can manage the daily menu effectively. | Chef asks: "How many 'Frango à Parmegiana' can we sell tonight?" |
| Nice-to-have | As a manager, I want to tell the AI to update the menu, and have it instantly reflect on the POS and digital displays, so changes are seamless. | Manager says: "Remove the 'Tilapia' from today's menu." |
| Nice-to-have | As a chef, I want to tell the AI a dish is out of stock, so it's immediately unavailable for servers and online orders. | Chef says: "We're out of 'Frango à Parmegiana' for the night." |

| Must-have    | As a manager, I want to ask the AI for sales insights, such as "What was our best-selling dish today?" so I can understand performance without running manual reports. | Manager asks: "Show me a summary of today's sales by category." |
| Nice-to-have | As a customer, I want to order via a QR code that opens a simple, mobile-friendly menu, so I can order at my own pace. | The web interface is clean, with clear images and descriptions. |
| Nice-to-have | As a manager, I want to tell the AI to create a promotion, like "happy hour for all beers," and have it apply automatically during the specified time. | Manager says: "Set up a 2-for-1 promotion on all draft beers from 6 PM to 8 PM tonight." |

| Must-have    | As a manager, I want a simple dashboard where the AI highlights key financial metrics (revenue, costs, profit), so I can see the most important information at a glance. | The main screen displays 3-4 key metrics with trends (e.g., "Revenue is up 5% this week"). |
| Must-have    | As a manager, I want to forward supplier invoices and expense receipts to the AI, so they are automatically categorized and recorded. | Manager sends a photo of a receipt to a dedicated system address. |
| Nice-to-have | As a manager, I want to ask the AI for a cash flow projection based on recent trends, so I can anticipate financial needs. | Manager asks: "Project our cash flow for the next 30 days." |

## Conclusion: Translating Stories into an Interface  

These user stories define what the user needs to accomplish and why. The next logical step is to visualize how these interactions will happen. To do this, we developed a wireframe that translates these conversational goals into a tangible user interface.  

The wireframe will serve as a low-fidelity blueprint for the application, focusing on the layout, user flow, and the core interaction model between the restaurant owner and the AI business analyst. This will ensure the final design remains centered on the primary value proposition: simplicity, accessibility, and proactive, intelligent assistance.
