### Video Intent & Content
The video will demonstrate:

1. **Opening Scene:** A restaurant owner/manager in their natural work environment
2. **Natural Interaction:** Show the user asking questions via chat:
   - "How did we perform yesterday?"
   - "What are my best-selling items this week?"
   - "Show me inventory items running low"
3. **AI Responses:** Display the conversational, helpful responses with data visualizations
4. **Action Taken:** Show how insights lead to immediate decisions (e.g., ordering more inventory, adjusting menu items)
5. **Multi-channel Access:** Briefly show the same conversation on mobile/Telegram

### Video Purpose
- **Reduce Friction:** Help potential users visualize themselves using the product
- **Build Trust:** Show real interactions, not just marketing claims
- **Demonstrate Simplicity:** Prove that anyone can use it without technical expertise
- **Highlight Speed:** Show how quick answers are compared to traditional systems

### Technical Specifications (Planned)
- **Duration:** 45-60 seconds
- **Format:** MP4, embedded with autoplay (muted) on desktop
- **Fallback:** Animated GIF or static screenshots for slower connections
- **Placement:** Center of hero section, replacing or augmenting the static chat example
- **Controls:** Play/pause, sound toggle, full-screen option

## Design Philosophy

### Color Psychology
- **Blue (primary):** Trust, professionalism, reliability
- **Purple:** Innovation, AI/technology association
- **Pink:** Approachability, human-centric design
- **Light gradient background:** Modern, clean, uncluttered

### Messaging Strategy
The landing page messaging focuses on:
1. **Simplicity over complexity:** "Chat" vs "navigate through menus"
2. **Speed over manual work:** "Instant insights" vs "generate reports"
3. **Empowerment:** "Transform how you manage" suggests user control
4. **Accessibility:** "Plain language" emphasizes no technical barrier

### Target Audience Alignment
The page directly addresses the primary user persona (owner/manager) by:
- Using restaurant-specific terminology (sales, inventory, orders)
- Showing practical, real-world questions they actually ask
- Focusing on business outcomes (profitability, efficiency)
- Avoiding technical jargon or implementation details

## Conversion Goals
1. **Primary:** Drive "Start Free Trial" sign-ups
2. **Secondary:** Engage users with "Watch Demo" to reduce uncertainty
3. **Tertiary:** Build brand awareness and position ChatWaiter as a modern alternative to legacy systems
